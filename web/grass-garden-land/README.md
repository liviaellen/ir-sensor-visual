# Grass Garden Land (flat)

This is a duplicated, flat-land variant of the original `grass-garden` project.

Notes:
- The `BlobGeometry` has been replaced with a flat plane for a garden/island look.
- Copy the real `public/models` and `public/textures` from the original project if you need the assets.

To run locally:

```bash
cd grass-garden-land
npm install
npm run dev
```
